In a science research lab, combining two nuclear chemicals produces a maximum energy<br>
that is the product of the energy of the two chemicals. The energy values of the chemical can be negative or positive.<br>
The scientist wishes to calculate the sum of the energies of the two chemicals which produces maximum energy on reaction. <br><br>
Write an algorithm to find the sum of energy of the two chemicals which produces maximum energy in reaction.<br>

``Inputs``<br>
The first line of the input consists of an integer representing the number of chemicals.<br>
The second line consists of N space-separated integers - (ener)0 (ener)1,..., (ener)N-1 representing the energles
of the chemicals.<br>
``Output``<br>
Print an integer representing the
sum of energy of the two chemicals
which produces maximum energy
on reaction.<br>
``Constraints``<br>
O ≤ numOfChem ≤ 106
-10° ≤ ener ≤ 106
Osi< numOfChem<br>
``Example``<br>
Input:<br>
7<br>
9 -38 -6 -7 8 10<br>
Output:<br>
19<br>
``Explanation:``<br>
The maximum product of the
energies is 90, I.e. 9*10.
So, the sum of the energies of the chemicals is 19.
