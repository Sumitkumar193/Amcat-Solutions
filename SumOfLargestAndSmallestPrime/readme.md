Jackson, a math research student, is developing an application on prime numbers. 
For the given two integers on the display of the application, the user has to the identify the largest
and smallest prime numbers within the given range (including the give values). Afterward the application
will sum the largest and smallest prime numbers. Jackson has to write an algorithm to find the sum of the
largest and smallest prime numbers for the given range.<br>

Write an algorithm to find the sum of the largest and smallest prime numbers for the given range.<br><br>

``Input``<br>
The first line of the input consists of an integer - rangeLeft, representing the minimum boundary value of the
given range.
The second line consists of an integer - rangeRight, representing the maximum boundary value of the given range.

``Output``<br>
Print an integer representing the sum of the largest and smallest prime numbers for the given range.<br>

``Example``
Input:<br>
-97
<br>50

Output:<br>
-50
<br>
``Explanation:``<br>
The smallest and largest prime numbers within the given range are<br>
-97 and 47 respectively. The sum of -97 and 47 is -50.<br>
So, the output is -50.
